# Vertical temperature profile assuming only plane parallel atmosphere is true

##### This project aimed at modeling vertical temperature profile using TOA temperature and surface temperature.

##### Model takes emission temperature and surface temperature as inputs and gives output number of layers in a planet and plot vertical temperature profile of a planet using only assumption that planet has Plane Parallel Atmosphere.

##### In this assumption, we consider that there are parallel layers of atmosphere present between the top of the atmosphere and surface of the planet. 

##### Then we calculate the temperature above each layer considering the temperature at the top of the atmosphere (Emission Temperature) and surface temperature.
